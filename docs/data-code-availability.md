## Data and Code Availability (for manuscript Section 6)

All computations were performed in Python. To ensure full reproducibility, this repository provides:
(i) `analysis.py` (end-to-end script),
(ii) `outputs/dataset_and_results.xlsx` (raw matrix, normalized matrix, CRITIC intermediate outputs, TOPSIS/VIKOR results, sensitivity analysis),
(iii) publication-ready figures (PNG, 300 dpi) under `outputs/figures/`.

The repository also contains documentation describing the provenance of occurrence proxies and the use of official investigation evidence for severity and detection logic.
